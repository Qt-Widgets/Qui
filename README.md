# Qui
<b>What is QUI?</b> QUI is a Qt UI component library (hence the name). It's a work in progress and currently only contains a few components but I'll be adding more in the future as I require them in other projects.

<b>Is there a demo?</b> Yes! If you clone the repo you can open the main Qt Project file and run the Examples project to see the components in action.

<b>C++ QWidget Components:</b>

<b>ImageLabel:</b> A replacement for QLabel when displaying images. Allows you to display a QPixmap or QImage with the aspect ratio preserved.

<b>AnimatedStackedWidget:</b> An animated replacement for the QStackedWidget class, allowing you to alternate between multiple widgets using a very flexible animation.
